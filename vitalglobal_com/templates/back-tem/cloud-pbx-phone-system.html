<p>The most recent cloud technologies, such as VoIP, hosted PBX, and PBX, may have caught our attention. The public has a difficult time distinguishing between cloud PBX and VoIP from an operational standpoint. We'll investigate this in further depth. Any firm must be aware of the differences between the old phone system and the new cloud-based PBX before updating the latter or moving to the former.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold text-blu">What is Cloud PBX and how does it differ from a traditional PBX?</h3>
 <p>Cloud PBX, which stands for Cloud-based Private Branch Exchange, is a system that operates only via the internet and automatically answers all incoming calls and routes them to the appropriate area or extension.</p>
 <p>In the past, PBX systems were installed on-site, and the setup's large amount of equipment need a special storage area. The installation of a typical PBX initially required greater costs, which dashed the dreams of companies that were operating with little capital. All those issues with cost and storage have been controlled with the emergence of cloud-based PBX. Cloud PBX is hosted in secure, out-of-the-way data centers that deliver services via the Internet.

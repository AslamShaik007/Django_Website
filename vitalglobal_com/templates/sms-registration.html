<h3 class="fw-bold text-blu my-4">Vitel Global’s SMS/MMS Content Policies</h3>

<p>   
Vitel Global is committed to offering the best possible customer care while attempting to get rid of spam, phishing, and fraudulent messages. The following policies apply to our SMS/MMS solutions, whether sent via the Vitel Global App, a third-party provider, or via the API, in order to help ensure that these objectives are achieved and in compliance with <a class="text-decoration" href="/static/assets/190719-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">CTIA messaging guidelines.</a></p>

<p>Beyond those that are mentioned below, there may be other policies, rules, and laws. The following is not legal advice. Given the type of message you want to convey, it is highly advised that you speak with a lawyer to better understand any legal responsibilities you may have.</p>

<h4>Enhanced Business SMS</h4>
<p>The Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy of Vitel Global must be followed when using Enhanced Business SMS.</p>

<h4>Vitel Global Enhanced Business SMS guidelines</h4>
<ul>
<li>Per originating number, do not send more than 50 SMS per minute.</li>
<li>Prior to sending any marketing, promotional, or informational materials, be sure to have the recipients' written consent.</li>
<li>When sending SMS, avoid using bought lists or lead lists generated by other parties.</li>
<li>When sending instructional, marketing, or promotional messages, clearly indicate how to unsubscribe.</li>
<li>Avoid utilising non-branded domains and link shorteners for embedded links.</li>
<li>Register your TCR brand as necessary before delivering SMS messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please consider using our High Volume SMS service, which permits up to 60 messages per minute for long code numbers and 180 messages per minute for toll-free numbers, if you need to send more than 50 messages per originating number every minute.</p>

<h4>Opt-in/ user consent</h4>
<p>Any number you intend to send an SMS message to must first have that person's express permission. It's vital to remember that acquiring a list of "users who have opted in to SMS" or responding instantly to a received message are not regarded to be valid forms of implied permission for SMS. If a user wants to receive SMS messages from you, they must request it. Keep in mind that permission is required before sending any campaign or message type. The receivers' express prior written authorization is required for any marketing or promotional messages.</p>
<p>A online form where it is made obvious that a user is opting into SMS texts is one way to acquire consent, as is having them send a message to your phone number. It is highly advised to employ a double opt-in, authenticating their number and receiving an SMS to confirm their consent.
Additionally, you need to keep track of consent, opt-ins, and opt-outs. In some circumstances, carriers could ask for evidence that a person has opted in, along with a description of your opt-in/opt-out procedure.</p>
<p>If opt-in is not ensured, mobile carriers or Vitel Global may restrict or stop your number or service.</p>

<h4>Opt-out</h4>
<p>Users must have a straightforward text option to unsubscribe from your SMS messaging. The CTIA rules include STOP and UNSUBSCRIBE as explicit command terms that must be complied with for opt-out requests.</p>
<p>Any instructional or commercial messages must have instructions for opting out.
When utilised outside of our High Volume SMS solution, long-code and Toll-free SMS do not automatically manage opt-out requests; instead, you must manage and keep track of opt-out requests.
Similarly, in order to prevent delivering SMS to customers who have opted out, you will need to manage opt-outs that you get through other channels.</p>

<h4>Barred campaigns</h4>
<p>Even while SMS is a fantastic way to interact with your opted-in clients, there are some constraints on the content and message types that can be delivered. All SMS solutions provided by Vitel Global are categorically forbidden from running the following campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisements related to loans and mortgage.</li>
<li>Credit repairing offers.</li>
<li>Debt relief related offers.</li>
<li>Debt collection.</li>
<li>Advertisements pertaining to work from home.</li>
<li>Shopper advertisements in a secret way.</li>
<li>Advertisements related to political background and messages.</li>
<li>Weaponry, Alcohol, Tobacco related advertisements.</li>
<li>Drug related advertisements. </li>
<li>Similar campaigns which are related to the above-mentioned activities. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The initiatives listed above are now prohibited, and Vitel Global is unable to grant any exceptions. Similar messages might also be rejected at the carriers' or Vitel Global's discretion. When messages (such an update on your loan application) are unintentionally prohibited, Vitel Global advises registering for a unique brand ID and a campaign tailored to your messages.</p>

<h4>Content that is Prohibited.</h4>
<p>The following message content is also categorically forbidden and may result in the carriers or Vitel Global blocking or suspending your service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any messages that break the law or our terms of service, including the acceptable use policy, in any way.</li>
<li>Regardless of legality, messages that engage in or promote sexual or pornographic entertainment.</li>
<li>Text messages or references to violence, hate speech, or other actions that are threatening, abusive, harassing, libellous, defamatory, deceptive, or fraudulent are prohibited.</li>
<li>Regardless of their legality, messages that reference substances that are listed as controlled narcotics under federal law, such as marijuana (cannabis)</li>
<li>Messages with affiliate or lead generation links from third parties</li>
<li>Messages that employ links that are misleading to the user or use links that are not what the user would expect based on the message wording.</li>
<li>messages designed to circumvent this rule or a carrier's rules (e.g. misspelling, uncommon capitalization, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Vitel Global retains the right to add to this list at any moment or decide, in its sole discretion, which messages are prohibited.</p>

<h4>Carrier charges and account restrictions</h4>
<p>In addition to fines and other penalties transmitted through Vitel Global by the carriers, accounts that violate Vitel Global or carrier rules and regulations may also be subject to reduced message deliverability, increased campaign registration requirements and fees, service suspension or termination.</p>
<p>It is your duty to follow to any recipient number policies and to be aware of any additional limits that may apply while sending SMS messages.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold text-blu my-4">Checklist for TCR Business SMS registration</h3>

<small>Last Updated: March 08, 2023</small>

<p>We've put together easy-to-follow recommendations to help you prepare for registering your company SMS with The Campaign Registry (TCR).</p>

<h4>Before you begin</h4>

<p>To avoid fees, gather the following information since each time you submit your application again, a cost is assessed.</p>

<h5>Verification letter</h5>

<p>You'll get a letter containing your approved registration details after registering with the IRS. If you register with the Canadian government, they'll send you a letter verifying your business number. The information you need for brand registration will be included in the letter from the US or Canadian authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal company name</li>
<li>Country of registration</li>
<li>EIN (US) / Business Number (Canada)</li>
<li>Legal company address</li>
</ul>

<h4>Organization Type</h4>


<p>If your company is publicly traded, have a copy of your SEC-issued stock symbol registration letter on hand. If not, you are a privately owned (such as an LLC) or non-profit organisation (ex. 706 business.)</p>

<h4>Industry</h4>

<p>What sector does your company work in? You must choose a vertical that most closely reflects your industry based on your response. The verticals that TCR offers are described in this article.</p>

<h4>Primary contact</h4>

<p>Have the name, position, address, phone number, and email of the contact on hand.</p>

<h4>Website URL</h4>

<p>You can choose not to submit this with your TCR registration.</p>

<h4>Proof of customer consent</h4>

<p>Take images of the website form, the paper form, or any other form you use to obtain clients' consent before sending SMS.</p>

<h4>Messaging examples</h4>

<p>: If you've been using SMS before TCR registration, you'll likely have example messages you've sent to customers.</p>

<h5>Consent</h5>

<p>: Create three messages dependent on the method you used to obtain the client's consent to send them an SMS.</p>

<h5>Opt-in, out, and help</h5>

<p>:&nbsp;What text messages do you send when you send an SMS to encourage clients to opt-in to messages, stop receiving SMSes, and request your assistance with a problem? To carry out any of the three activities, you'll need the language for each message type and the precise word they texted.</p>

<h4>Company SMS phone numbers</h4>

<p>What text messages do you send when you send an SMS to encourage clients to opt-in to messages, stop receiving SMSes, and request your assistance with a problem? To carry out any of the three activities, you'll need the language for each message type and the precise word they texted.</p>

<h3>Additional tips</h3>

<p>Here are some additional things to keep in mind before you register with TCR.</p>

<ul>
<li>It may take 20 to 30 business days to complete this process. Your wait time for approval will be shorter if you submit successfully on your first try.</li>

  <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="nav-mms"><h3 class="fw-bold text-blu my-4">Registration Process</h3>

<h5>Why Did Messaging Registration Change?</h5>

<p>Mobile carriers are now forcing any business users that send SMS/MMS messages over 10-digit numbers (A2P 10DLC) to have those numbers registered with an organisation called The Campaign Registry due to changes to the existing messaging landscape (TCR). https://www.campaignregistry.com/.</p>

<p>The goal is to reduce text message spam, which is becoming a bigger issue for their mobile clients. By registering with TCR, you give TCR permission to review your use-case for the purpose for which you intend to use messaging, link the Brand (the company sending the messages) and the Campaigns (each individual use-case), as well as the list of phone numbers the messages will be sent from, with the goal of enabling complete traceability back to the message's originator. The cell carriers will gladly issue us a fine if it is found that your communications are not compliant, and we will cheerfully pass it along to you. The cell carriers will fully stop allowing messages to be sent to your number if you repeatedly break the rules.</p>

<p>Beginning on <span class="text-danger">May 1st, 2022</span>, we shall take the action of turning off all SMS/MMS messaging for use with Vitel Global numbers in order to avoid the possibility of financial penalties.</p>

<p>The source numbers must register with TCR if you wish to continue sending messages via SMS. However, we cannot permit you to send SMS messages once they have been disabled until the entire registration procedure is finished and approved.</p>

<h5>Registration Steps</h5>

<p>Fortunately, you don't have to register directly with TCR as you are one of our customers. We will submit your Brand and Campaign details to TCR as your CSP (Campaign Service Provider). Having said that, we will ask a lot of questions about your business, the purposes for messaging, and the list of phone numbers you'll be using to send messages. TCR NEEDS ALL OF THIS INFORMATION TO EVALUATE AND VET YOUR REQUEST. They have received training in understanding what will get your registration request past the cell carrier's scrutiny.</p>

<p>NOTE: Registration fees also apply to brands and campaigns. At the end of this article are the costs given.</p>

<p>Cheat Sheet Form&nbsp;</p>

<p>A2P 10DLC Messaging Campaign Form&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the data we require to submit your request to TCR is on this form.</p>

<p>Brand Information&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information about the brand is on the first page. Given that this is information about your business, it should be rather obvious what to fill out. If your brand uses messaging for a variety of use cases, you can have many campaigns.</p>

<p>Campaign Information&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Campaign you will be filing is on the second page. Even while the term "campaign" is used loosely here and is typically linked with a text message blast, it actually refers to the message content when submitting for messaging use-cases.</p>

<p>The campaign you choose for your use truly depends on how you engage with customers through messaging and, more crucially, the content of those communications.</p>

<p>Given how complicated the mobile carriers made this, it's a lot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help you decide how to complete the campaign information, we'll present some of the information since you don't actually need to be aware of it all.</p>

<p>A document that we have has a list of best practises for messaging campaigns. The portions that can be pertinent for your company are Sections 6 and 8, although keep in mind that this document contains a lot of detailed information. This document contains some helpful advice on how to comply with the content policies of mobile carriers, which is where the majority of the attention is directed.</p>

<h5>Messaging Best Practices</h5>
 

<p>For instance, if you are using messaging with a soft client, frequent use-cases include "Low-volume mixed". Choose "Customer Care" or "Marketing" as the type of content you might send when selecting this campaign type. For automated systems, several of the other types are more prevalent (2FA, Account Notifications, etc). These types won't be suitable for the "low-volume mixed" use case because the volume will most likely be larger. Remember that the expected content of your communications will influence the use-case category you select.</p>

These types won't be suitable for the "low-volume mixed" use case because the volume will most likely be larger. Remember that the expected content of your communications will influence the use-case category you select.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To assist TCR in assessing your use-case and content, the Campaign Description should discuss how you are using messaging. Sample messages are also requested.</p>

<p>The list of phone numbers (TNs) that should be permitted to send and receive SMS and MMS messages as part of this campaign is listed last.</p>

<p>Up to 49 TNs may be listed for usage with a campaign. In order for TCR and the cell carriers to assess why you need more than that for a "campaign," above 49 TNs entails a very high price. This practise is known as number pooling. Be very picky about the phone numbers you message from while selecting these TNs. The carriers are also thinking about regulations that would govern how rapidly a number might be changed from one campaign to another.</p>

 

<h4>Where To Send the Form&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Once you have the form filled out, you can email this to <a href="mailto:sales@vitelglobal.com">sales@vitelglobal.com</a> Please include the following:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subject Line: SMS/MMS Brand/Campaign Form for Vitel Global</p>

<p>Body: In your email request, provide additional contact information, such as the name of an authorised user on your account, as well as a brief description of what you are wanting.</p>

<p>Attachment: In your email request, provide additional contact information, such as the name of an authorised user on your account, as well as a brief description of what you are wanting.</p>

 

<h4>Fees</h4>

<p>For their numerous services, The Campaign Registry (TCR) charges fees. These are the fees that we will be passing along:</p>

<table class="table"> <tbody><tr><td><p>Fee&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Cost&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Description&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Brand Registration and Vetting&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>$10&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>One-time TCR Fee per Brand/Company&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Campaign Registration Fee&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>$15&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Fee per campaign&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A regular brand and campaign registration, for instance, would cost around $25 in fees. This would be made up of the $15 per campaign fee in addition to the $10 TCR brand fee. Depending on the content, you could just need one campaign for your brand. If you are sending a bigger volume of messages and sending content that would fit into distinct use-cases, you would require separate campaigns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Penalties&nbsp;</p>

<p>Observe your output. T-Mobile will impose severe penalties, in particular, for any content infractions. The following is just one illustration:</p>

<table class="table"> <tbody><tr><td><p>Penalty&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Fee&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>Description&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>10DLC A2P Text Enablement Non-Compliance Violation&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>$10,000&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>T-Mobile penalty for sending texts from non-approved numbers - per violation&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>10DLC A2P Program Evasion Non-Compliance Violation&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>$1,000&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>T-Mobile violation for using evasive measures - per violation&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>10DLC A2P Content Non-Compliance&nbsp;<br>Violation&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>$10,000&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>T-Mobile penalty for content violations - per violation&nbsp;</p></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we are assessed one of these costs because of an infringement on your brand or campaign, we will pay these costs through to you. If you break the rules repeatedly, your brand will be excluded from further messaging initiatives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties could be added in the future by other operators.</p></div>

<h3 class="fw-bold text-blu my-4">STIR/SHAKEN: HOW VITEL GLOBAL TACKELS THE ROBO CALLS.</h3>

<h3>STIR/SHAKEN – In-detail.</h3>

<p>How many times have you answered a call you didn't intend to because the caller ID information appeared familiar, only to find out that the area code and phone number were faked? This specific scenario is what the new FCC regulations, which become effective on June 30, 2021, are meant to prevent.</p>

<p>Part of the TRACED Act, the new criteria comprise a set of technical standards and protocols—called STIR/SHAKEN—for validating caller ID information.</p>

<p>A new set of protocols called STIR/SHAKEN gives voice service providers a mechanism to "sign" caller ID as real on outgoing calls and to recognise incoming calls with a fake caller ID. When these procedures are combined, phone companies are able to "attest" to the origin of calls and "authenticate" those signatures to inform call recipients when a call has been confirmed.</p>

<h4>Three Levels of Attestation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A-level attestation: The origin of a call and the user/extension number's authorization to use the number have both been confirmed by the service provider.</li>

<li>B-level attestation: Although the call origination has been verified, the service provider is unable to confirm that the caller has permission to use the calling number.</li>

<li>C-Level attestation: Despite having placed the call on the network, the service provider is unable to verify its origin.</li>
</ul>


<p>We are pleased to inform that Vitel Global has completely implemented the STIR/SHAKEN protocol and has submitted its certification of conformity to the Robocall Mitigation Database of the Federal Communications Commission. Our technology authenticates STIR/SHAKEN headers on all incoming calls and signatures all calls that come from the Vitel Global network.</p>

<h4>What does this mean for our customers?</h4>

<p>The STIR/SHAKEN protocol allows you to check the authenticity of an inbound phone number before answering an incoming call. Your phone will display "Suspected Robocall" as the caller ID if it isn't.</p>

<p>You don't need to take any action to make sure that your outbound calls are legal and properly signed. We take care of everything for you.</p>

<p>The STIR/SHAKEN implementation by Vitel Global is already complete, and the company has submitted their certification of STIR/SHAKEN compliance to the FCC's Robocall Mitigation Database. The routing or completion of calls for Vitel Global MVP clients won't change as a result, and no action is necessary for all calls to be certified. Users calling from the Vitel Global app to another Vitel Global user won't experience any changes, either.</p>

<p>However, it's crucial to remember that even if a call is authentic, incoming calls made via a carrier that has not completely adopted STIR/SHAKEN may not be verified. Vitel Global will only transfer calls after March 10, 2023, to service providers that have submitted certifications of STIR/SHAKEN compliance to the FCC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Facilitating smooth, authorized phone calls</h4>

<p>Users of Vitel Global can rest easy knowing that we adhere to the STIR/SHAKEN legislation to the letter once the new regulations take effect. We are making every effort to lessen robocalls and give customers the resources they require to recognise the calls they want to answer.</p>
